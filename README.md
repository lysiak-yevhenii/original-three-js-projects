# Three.js Visual Projects

This repository contains two interactive 3D graphics projects built with Three.js.

## Project 1: Along Curve

### Description
An animation that moves the camera along a curved path, featuring:
- Procedurally generated tube geometry with wireframe rendering
- Animated cubic boxes scattered along the curve with rotation effects
- Bloom post-processing effects for enhanced visuals
- Interactive orbit controls for manual camera manipulation

### Features
- Smooth camera movement along Catmull-Rom curve
- Dynamic box rotation animations with edge highlighting
- Scene fog for depth perception
- Unreal-style bloom effects

## Project 2: Earth Visualization

### Description
A detailed 3D visualization of Earth with dynamic day/night cycles, featuring:
- Realistic Earth texture mapping with day/night transitions
- Dynamic cloud layer with subtle animation
- Atmospheric glow using Fresnel shading
- Starfield background with thousands of particles

### Features
- Custom shader-based day/night cycle
- Animated cloud coverage
- Atmospheric rim lighting effect
- Orbital controls for viewer interaction
- Accurate Earth axis tilt (23.4Â°)

## Technologies Used
- Three.js for 3D rendering
- Custom GLSL shaders
- JavaScript modules
- HTML5/CSS3

## Running the Projects
1. Serve the project directory using a local web server
2. Open the respective project's `index.html` in a modern browser

Interact with the 3D scenes using mouse/touch controls:
- Left click + drag to rotate
- Right click + drag to pan
- Scroll to zoom

## Browser Support
These projects require a modern browser with WebGL support.
